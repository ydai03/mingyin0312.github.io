## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).
Why Jekyll? Read [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)!


### Installation

#### Local setup

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.

#### Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

**For project pages (default):**

- Make changes, commit, and push!
- After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
- The `master` branch should be used for the source code of your webpage and `gh-pages` branch (will be created on the first deployment) will be used for deployment.

**For personal and organization webpages:**
- Make sure you correctly named your repository as `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
- After cloning this repository, [rename the branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch) with the source code from `master` to `source`.
- Make sure the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` are empty.
- Make changes, commit, and push!

<details><summary><strong>Manual deployment to GitHub Pages:</strong></summary>

If you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, run the deploy script from the root directory of your repository:
```bash
$ ./bin/deploy [--user]
```
uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.
The optional flag `--user` tells it to deploy to `master` and use `source` for the source code instead.
Using `master` for deployment is a convention for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Deployment to another hosting server (non GitHub Pages):</strong></summary>

If you decide to not use GitHub Pages and host your page elsewhere, simply run:
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
which will (re-)generate the static webpage in the `_site/` folder.
Then simply copy the contents of the `_site/` foder to your hosting server.

**Note:** Make sure to correctly set the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to `your-domain.com/your-project/`, you must set `url: your-domain.com` and `baseurl: /your-project/`. If you are deploing directly to `your-domain.com`, leave `baseurl` blank. 

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Deployment to a separate repository (advanced users only):</strong></summary>

**Note:** Do not try using this method unless you know what you are doing (make sure you are familiar with [publishing sources](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)). This approach allows to have the website's source code in one repository and the deployment version in a different repository.

Let's assume that your website's publishing source is a `publishing-source` sub-directory of a git-versioned repository cloned under `$HOME/repo/`.
For a user site this could well be something like `$HOME/<user>.github.io`.

Firstly, from the deployment repo dir, checkout the git branch hosting your publishing source.

Then from the website sources dir (commonly your al-folio fork's clone):
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build --destination $HOME/repo/publishing-source
```

This will instruct jekyll to deploy the website under `$HOME/repo/publishing-source`.

**Note:** Jekyll will clean `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` before building!

The quote below is taken directly from the [jekyll configuration docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/):

> Destination folders are cleaned on site builds
>
> The contents of `<destination>` are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the `<keep_files>` configuration directive.
>
> Do not use an important location for `<destination>`; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.

If `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` contains files that you want jekyll to leave untouched, specify them under `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.
In its default configuration, al-folio will copy the top-level `README.md` to the publishing source. If you want to change this behaviour, add `README.md` under `exclude` in `_config.yml`.

**Note:** Do _not_ run `jekyll clean` on your publishing source repo as this will result in the entire directory getting deleted, irrespective of the content of `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.

#### Upgrading from a previous version

If you installed **al-folio** as described above, you can upgrade to the latest version as follows:

```bash
# Assuming the current directory is <your-repo-name>
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/v0.3.5
```

If you have extensively customized a previous version, it might be trickier to upgrade.
You can still follow the steps above, but `git rebase` may result in merge conflicts that must be resolved.
See [git rebase manual](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase) and how to [resolve conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase) for more information.
If rebasing is too complicated, we recommend to re-install the new version of the theme from scratch and port over your content and changes from the previous version manually.



## Features

### Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/img/publications-screenshot.png" width=800></p>

<details><summary><strong>Author annotation:</strong></summary>

In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in `_config.yml`:
```
scholar:
  last_name: Einstein
  first_name: [Albert, A.]
```
If the entry matches the last name and one form of the first names, it will be underlined. 
Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.
The coauthor data format in `_data/coauthors.yml` is as follows,
```
"Adams":
  - firstname: ["Edwin", "E.", "E. P.", "Edwin Plimpton"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams

"Podolsky":
  - firstname: ["Boris", "B.", "B. Y.", "Boris Yakovlevich"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky

"Rosen":
  - firstname: ["Nathan", "N."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen

"Bach": 
  - firstname: ["Johann Sebastian", "J. S."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach

  - firstname: ["Carl Philipp Emanuel", "C. P. E."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach
```
If the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided. 

</details>


### Collections

This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories.
The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`.
Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page.
Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/img/projects-screenshot.png" width=700></p>

You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is.
To do this, edit the collections in the `_config.yml` file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`.


### Layouts

**al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts.

#### The iconic style of Distill

The theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) style:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/distill-screenshot.png" width=700></a></p>

For more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `<d-*>` tags, please refer to [the example](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2018/distill/).

#### Full support for math & code

**al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes):

<p align="center">
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/math/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/math-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/code/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/code-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
</p>

#### Photos

Photo formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/).
Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/1_project/">
    <img src="assets/img/photos-screenshot.png" width="75%">
  </a>
</p>


### Other features

#### Theming
Six beautiful theme colors have been selected to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing `$theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.

#### Social media previews
**al-folio** supports preview images on social media.
To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your `_config.yml`.
Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews.
This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable.
If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your `_config.yml`.
In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.

## Google Analytics 

To enable google analytics, one need to first run 
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
to enable off-build for your website (and then `git push`) even though your are using GitHub Pages.
